# Langchain_p


In this LangChain project, I set up a virtual environment, managed the OpenAI API key, and installed essential libraries.

I explained how the temperature parameter in language models affects creativity in output. Demonstrating practical
aspects, I showcased model predictions and results, exploring Hugging Face models and integrating them with
LangChain. 

A simple comparison highlighted the responses of OpenAI GPT-3.5 versus Hugging Face LLM models. I
used prompt templates for structured input and combined multiple chains through the Simple Sequential Chain
approach. 

Shifting to application development, I created a basic app using Streamlit, showing how it captures user input
and interacts with the OpenAI model. Finally, I deployed the app on Hugging Face Spaces, included secret keys, and
conducted thorough testing in a public space.
